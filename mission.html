<p>We are living in a time when undeniable truth has become nearly impossible to find. With a seemingly exponential increases in fake news and Donald Trump’s “Alternative Facts”, becoming an everyday occurrence, it has become harder and harder to decipher what is true and what is false. The Internet has presented the opportunity for anyone to put misinformation out to the masses. This is only perpetuated through the use of social media and the bubbles that many of us choose to reside in. <p>
Tabs On Trump aims do just what it name implies, keep tabs on the words our President is putting out to the masses. We are here to call the President on his bluffs. We have taken the many “Alternative Facts” of Donald Tump and sorted them into a digestible interactive list.<p>
We want Donald Trump to know that fact is not up for debate. He does not have the authority to determine his own truths.
